<p>This summary is from the sermon which Pastor Kwang hoon, Jeon has delivered.
(Pastor Jeon is from South Korea, a genuine pastor of Sarang Jeil church who really loves God and Korea.)</p>
<h3 id="what-is-true-self">What is True self?</h3>
<p>= soul contained in body, not fleshly body</p>
<h3 id="the-three-main-functions-of-the-soul">The three main functions of the soul</h3>
<p>(Each spirit and soul have these following natures)</p>
<ol>
<li>Thought (T)</li>
<li>Feeling (F)</li>
<li>Decision/Will (D)</li>
</ol>
<p>When the soul&rsquo;s TFD is expressed outside the body, it is <strong>expressed through words.</strong> <em><strong>That is, words come out carrying the soul.</strong></em>
John 6:63 says ‚ÄúIt is the spirit that gives life, and the flesh is useless. <strong>The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>When a word enters into another person, it has an influence, so you must listen carefully when you listen.
In the words of a person with an unclean spirit, an unclean spirit comes out. <strong>Listening to obscene people, discouraged people, sad people means that negative, passive, and destructive words can negatively affect those who hear without knowing.</strong> People who have been close to the person who committed suicide are susceptible to suicide.
Conversely, when you listen to positive and enterprising words such as ‚Äúyou can do it, what do you mean if you can? There is nothing impossible for a believer. If there is God and if I am, everything is possbible!‚Äù, it really helps. So, we must listen to good words.</p>
<p>It is very important to hear something many times. <strong>Blessed are those to whom the word of God enters!</strong> It is a blessing to be close to someone who speaks good words. <em><strong>The best of all good words is the Word of God. Let us be close to the Word of God!</strong></em></p>
<p>What value will it have when the Word of God enters us? If Samsung Electronics&rsquo; semiconductor blueprint goes into an iPad that costs $700, that iPad price will be billions of dollar. Likewise, <strong>when the word of God enters a person, he becomes a valuable servant before God.</strong></p>
<h3 id="like-humans-the-spirit-of-god-has-also-tfd">Like humans, the Spirit of God has also TFD.</h3>
<p>God also comes out through the Word. <strong>The Word is God.</strong> When the Word enters a person and is united with his thoughts, feelings, and will, he become a person of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 10:34-35 Jesus answered them, Has it not been written in your Law, &ldquo;I said, you are gods&rdquo;? (Psa. 82:6) If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John 4:24 God is a spirit, and the ones worshiping Him must worship in spirit and truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Praise üéµ Standing on the Promises</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
</br>
When God's word is united with man's TFD, God's power comes out of man. When the Word comes in, miracles happen. (Peter walking on the water) When the word enters, the sickness is healed, the cancer is healed, miracles happen.
<p>The Word of God must capture man, so man‚Äôs will may die and God&rsquo;s will live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ, and I live; yet no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith toward the Son of God, the One loving me and giving Himself over on my behalf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the devil is also a spirit (a spirit that moves around the earth(Job 1:7)), he has his TFD, too. The devil also comes through words. When the devil&rsquo;s words stick to humans and unite, the devil&rsquo;s power comes from man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 13:2 And supper having occurred, the Devil having put already into the heart of Simon&rsquo;s son Judas Iscariot that he should betray Him,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John 13:27 And after the morsel, then Satan entered into that one. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People captured with the devil&rsquo;s TFD are negative, passive, critical, aggressive, and sullen(dark) in everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalms 107:10-11 Those who live in the darkness, and in the shadow of death, being prisoners in affliction and iron, because they rebelled against the words of God, and despised the counsel of the Most High;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalms 107:20 He sent His word and healed them; and delivered them from all their pitfalls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>But when the word of God enters into them, the devil goes away and the straits disappears.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Praise üéµ Onward, Christian Soldiers</p>

<hr>
</br>
<h3 id="the-word-of-god-enters-into-them-when-they-say-amen-to-the-word-of-god">The Word of God enters into them when they say Amen to the Word of God.</h3>
<p>The word of God must come in, not the words of man or the devil.
<strong>When the Word comes in, you must conceive by faith.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 4:1-2 Then let us fear lest in any way a promise having been left to enter into His rest, that any of you may seem to come short. For, indeed, we have had the gospel preached to us , even as they also; but the word did not profit those hearing it , not having been mixed with faith in the ones who heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the listener does not receive it by faith, the work of God&rsquo;s word does not take place.
<em><strong>Wherever the Word of God goes, two edged sword (Heb. 4:12) to execute the Word</strong></em> - The sword of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 6:17) and the sword of an angel (Psalm 103:19-20, Joshua 5:13-14, Gen. 3:24).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalms 103:20 Bless Jehovah, O angels of His; mighty in strength; doing His word; listening to the voice of His word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When the Word of God hits your heart, your heart gets hot.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 24:32 And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as He spoke to us in the highway, and as He opened up to us the Scriptures?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Which is better? to make money with the power of man or to make money with the power of God? Will it work well for you to study with your own strength or for you to study with the power of God? You know the answer, definitely.
Although we are human, we must live by the power of God. To do so, you must unite with the Word of God.
However, this does not work well because the devil (the thief) deceives your  thoughts without your knowing. (See Judas Iscariot in John 13:2)</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-know-whether-if-the-word-of-god-is-attached-to-our-tfd">How can we know whether if the Word of God is attached to our TFD?</h3>
<p><strong>When thoughts are united, Hope (a sense of expectation) arises.</strong>
<strong>When Feelings(emotions) are united, Joy, Love toward God and Thanksgiving arise.</strong>
<strong>When the will are united, Faith arises.</strong>
Your eyes will shine. You will speak enterprising, positive and promising words!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 15:7 If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, whatever you desire you will ask, and it shall happen to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <em><strong>His word remains in you</strong></em> means as following.</p>
<ul>
<li>you enter into Him,</li>
<li>His Word unites with your TFD,</li>
<li>you belong to God and become one with Him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abraham believed that the Word of God had already been fulfilled, and he gave glory to God before it happened! <em><strong>Faith is not believing what is visible, but believing in the Word of God.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 4:19-22 And being about a hundred years old , not weakening in faith, he did not consider his body to have died already, nor yet the death of Sarah&rsquo;s womb, and did not stagger by unbelief at the promise of God, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what He has promised, He is also able to do. Because of this, &ldquo;it was also counted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; (Gen. 15:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>People must keep their Thought, Feeling and Desicion(TFD). However, <strong>since humans do not have the power to protect themselves, they must always rely on the power of God&rsquo;s Word.</strong></p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo; disciples who understood the will of God&rsquo;s Word united their TFD with the Word saying Amen, while Judas Iscariot, who followed Jesus for money, received the same Word but failed, to whom Satan entered into.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 13:19 Everyone hearing the Word of the kingdom, and not understanding, then the evil one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is that sown by the roadside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who are possessed by demons never say Amen.
<strong>When the Word comes in, we must hold on to the intention of the Word with saying Amen.</strong></p>
<p>Meditate the Word a lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 4:20-23 My son, listen to my words; bow your ear to what I say; let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart; for they are life to those who find them, and healing to all his flesh. Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>You must be immersed in the Word to win the spiritual battle. Let&rsquo;s be a victor forever until we go to the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom!</strong></p>
