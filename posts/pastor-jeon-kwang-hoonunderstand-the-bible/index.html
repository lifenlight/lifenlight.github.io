        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SJ3PCL5eo&list=PLoQr3ZnvA8NvCEN4qFny9jJi64ZsTno0R" target="_blank">Original Video</a></p>
<p>This summary is from the sermon which Pastor Kwang hoon, Jeon has delivered.
(Pastor Jeon is from South Korea, a genuine pastor of Sarang Jeil church who really loves God and Korea.)</p>
<h3 id="the-bible-was-written-by-moses-and-interpreted-by-apostle-paul"><em>The Bible was written by Moses and interpreted by Apostle Paul.</em></h3>
<p>There are people whom God let know the Bible. He showed it to the humble Paul.
When Moses climbed Mount Sinai, he saw the heavenly prototype and then wrote the Pentateuch(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and  built the tabernacle on the earthly ground.</p>
<p>Paul went to the third heaven and saw the same what Moses saw and wrote the 13 letters of Paul (Romans ~ Hebrews) and also built the body of Christ(the church) on the earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>being built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the cornerstone, in whom every building having been fitted together grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:20-21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abraham saw Jerusalem in heaven and called it Salem City, and David built Jerusalem City. When looking at the city of Jerusalem on Google Maps, it looks like the Old Testament tabernacle.
In complete Revelation, the Apostle John saw the city of New Jerusalem. They all saw the same thing and talked about it.</p>
<p>All those who have seen the heavenly prototype couldn&rsquo;t help but try to bring down the heavenly blueprint to the ground. God lifted up the face of these people at the center of the world.
Pastor Kwang-hoon Jeon is going forward for Korean unification through the gospel and for the establishment of the World Christianity Center.(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqeFpK6Onls" target="_blank">youtube clip</a>)</p>

</center>
<p>It is the tabernacle, Jerusalem city, and the church that the blueprint(heavenly prototype) came down to the earth. Just like making a blueprint before building a building, <strong>God&rsquo;s blueprint was planned</strong> <em><strong>&ldquo;BEFORE&rdquo;</strong></em>  <strong>the creation of the world.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>the mystery</strong> having been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now was revealed to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, who is <strong>Christ in you</strong>, the hope of glory; (Colossians 1:27)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But now they stretch forth to a better, that is, a heavenly land . Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, for Him to be called their God; for He prepared a city for them.(Hebrews 11:16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have seen him(Christ in heaven) brought the blueprint to the earth. Wherever Paul went, he made there church. He also preached even in prison.</p>
<p>When God created heaven and earth, <em><strong>God really wants to say about Christ through creation of the world!</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-1-gen-115-_-salvation">Day 1 (Gen. 1:1~5) _ <em>Salvation</em></h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s first beginning intent to bring down the heavenly blueprint to the earth through the process of creating this world begins with Genesis 1:1.
The saying that &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; on the first day does not refer to the physical light of this world. (The sun and the moon and stars were created on the fourth day.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was the true Light</strong>; He enlightens every man coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to the ones believing into His name, (John 1:9~12)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="god-who-created-this-world-came-to-this-world-as-a-man-in-flesh">God who created this world came to this world as a man in flesh.</h3>
<p><em><strong>Proclaiming this great fact is to have the light of the first day. (the beginning of the gospel)</strong></em> If we believe this with the fact that God <em><strong>REALLY</strong></em> wants us to know, the salvation of our spirit take place in us. In other words, Satan would let us know that <em><strong>NOT !</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world. <strong>By this know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.</strong> And every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God; and this is the antichrist which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world. (1 John 4:1~3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you admits by your mouth that Jesus Christ has come as a man to the earth, Satan&rsquo;s encampment - chaos, emptiness, and darkness(Gen. 1:2) will be destroyed.
<em><strong>It is Jesus Christ that God came as a man.</strong></em></p>
<p>God came as a man for your salvation.(Let there be light!) God tells the most important things first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in whom <strong>the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving,</strong> so that the brightness of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them. For we do not proclaim ourselves, <em><strong>but Christ Jesus as Lord</strong></em>, and ourselves your slaves for the sake of Jesus. Because it is God who said, &ldquo;Out of darkness Light shall shine,&rdquo; who shone in our hearts to give the brightness of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:4â€“6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satan is afraid for you to know Genesis 1!
<strong>Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord is saved.</strong> The person whom the Holy Spirit enters and leads his way is completely different from the one who leads his own life. <em><strong>Those who call on the Lord overcome three things (chaos, emptiness and darkness) with the light of Jesus.</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-2-gen-168-_-no-longer-i-but-jesus-christ">Day 2 (Gen. 1:6~8) _ <em>No longer I but Jesus Christ</em></h2>
<p><em>(God&rsquo;s heart aches to the death of Jesus on the cross who came to the world to save our sins - No mention that God saw that it was good on the second day.)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And God said, Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and <em><strong>let it divide between</strong></em> the waters and the waters. (Genesis 1:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Dividing water means death on the cross of Jesus Christ.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released His spirit. And, behold, the veil of the Holy Place was <em><strong>torn into two</strong></em> from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared! (Matthew 27:50~51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greek word for &ldquo;torn&rdquo; has the same meaning of the Hebrew original word for &ldquo;dividing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As soon as we accept that Jesus died on the cross for us, we are <em><strong>divided</strong></em> from our sinful self - which was from oldself Adam&rsquo;s sinful nature, character, personality etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been crucified with Christ, and I live; yet <em><strong>no longer I, but Christ lives in me.</strong></em> And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith toward the Son of God, the One loving me and giving Himself over on my behalf. (Galatians 2:20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The degree of how much our own self is dead(shattered) means the degree or level of our faith. It is the most difficult to be divided from our oldself. Most Christians do not overcome the second day and end their lives at this stage.</strong></em></p>
<p>The difficulties of economy, relationship, circumstances, and events are God&rsquo;s grace for the destruction of the oldself. The people or events that make us hard have been given by God with a special mission to destroy our oldself! (Give thanks to God!).
Satan would stick to your oldself unless you are divided from your oldself so God can&rsquo;t handle you.
God let Israel passed through the 40 years of wilderness to break the oldself of the children of Israel.<em><strong>(to humble before God)</strong></em></p>
<p>After eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, human has become to have his own independent will and independent opinion away from God&rsquo;s will. So human-beings are born with an independent will. Satan was originally an seraph, but was driven out of his place after having an independent will away from God.</p>
<h3 id="gods-shortcomings"><em>God&rsquo;s shortcomings</em></h3>
<p>When God tells us to do what we hate, there must be <em><strong>something Good</strong></em> waiting behind it. If you don&rsquo;t understand it, just obey
! Soon the will of God will be gradually revealed.</p>

<hr>
<p>We must unconditionally say Amen to God&rsquo;s will. <em><strong>Amen means to deny ourself and to accept the Word of God.</strong></em> Not doing Amen means not to abandon your stubbornness. Our oldself is broken when we say Amen. Be blessed by Amen. As we repeat Amens, the will of the Bible comes into us and our stubbornness collapse.
Let us contemplate how Jesus prayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>saying, Father, if You will, take away this cup from Me; but <strong>let not My will be done, but Your will.</strong> (Luke 22:42)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-3-gen-1913-_-resurrection">Day 3 (Gen. 1:9~13) _ <em>Resurrection</em></h2>
<p>During the Israeli feast, the bread was wrapped and buried on the Feast of Unleavened Bread (to moisten it to make it easier to eat), and three days later, when it was taken out of the ground, the wrapper of bread appear, which symbolizes Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.(Gen. 1:9 Let the dry land appear.)</p>
<p>There are three types of resurrection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Resurrection of the spirit (salvation)</li>
<li>The Last Resurrection â€“ When Jesus come again, he brings spirits to put on the resurrection body.
<em><strong>The appearance of the resurrection will be different from each other.(1 Cor. 15:41~42)</strong></em> Â 
Man&rsquo;s ultimate goal should be winning the better resurrection!</li>
<li>Resurrection of life (realistic world) â€“ money, material, household, business, children prosper.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expression of Resurrection - Hallelujah!</p>

<h2 id="day-4-gen-11419-_-ones-divinely-appointed-work">Day 4 (Gen. 1:14~19) _ <em>One&rsquo;s divinely appointed work</em></h2>
<p>The sun, moon and stars are interpreted as occupational positions by Joseph&rsquo;s dream. It was the case of Jesus Christ sitting on the throne after the ascension.
<em><strong>A person is born with heavenly calling that what he should do in his life.(God&rsquo;s providence)</strong></em></p>
<h4 id="how-to-make-sure-that-what-you-are-doing-is-a-god-given-vocation">How to make sure that what you are doing is a God-given vocation?</h4>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t enjoy what you are doing and complain, that is not your place, but wandering place.
Do you want to do it even when you are born again? If not, it is not your place.
After passing through the spiritual condition of the third day, God gives your  place originally prepared only for you suddenly one day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Give Thanksgiving to God!</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-5-gen-12023-_-expansion-of-lifepentecost">Day 5 (Gen. 1:20~23) _ <em>Expansion of life(Pentecost)</em></h2>
<p>Be Fruitful and multiply! Fill! Expansion of life(Gospel) and expansion of influence.
When filled with the Holy Spirit, you will have an good influence on people around you. There are even people who want to help. <em><strong>Reproduction and enlargement of the Christ in you occurs.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going, then, disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days until the completion of the age. Amen.(Matthew 28:19~20)</p>

<h2 id="day-7-gen-213-_-completion-and-rest">Day 7 (Gen. 2:1~3) _ <em>Completion and Rest</em></h2>
<p>Enjoy eternal rest in Jesus (Eternal Life!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea no longer is. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, having been prepared as a bride, having been adorned for her Husband. And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God with men! And He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no longer, nor mourning, nor outcry, nor pain will be any longer; for the first things passed away.(Revelation 21:1~4)</p>
