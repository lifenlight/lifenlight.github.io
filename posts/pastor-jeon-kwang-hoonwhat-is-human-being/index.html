<p>This summary is from the sermon which Pastor Kwang hoon, Jeon has delivered.
(Pastor Jeon is charge of Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, South Korea, a genuine pastor who really loves God and Korea.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/15/912682401/the-volatile-mix-of-a-south-korean-church-politics-and-the-coronavirus" target="_blanck">[News about pastor Jeon]</a>)</p>

<p>People in the world say that human is made up of body and mind(soul), but <strong>in reality there is a spirit in the mind.</strong></p>
<p>The flesh came from the earth. (Genesis 2:7 Jehovah God formed the man out of dust from the ground, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul). Chemical analysis shows the part of human body is the same ingredient as soil.</p>
<p>The body gains strength by supplying earthly materials. <strong>The food of mind is knowledge.</strong> A person who lives in prison for a long time becomes a blank person for a lack of knowledge. Therefore <strong>the mind(soul) must be constantly supplied with knowledge (studying, reading, listening to music, listening to lectures, etc).</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And may the God of peace Himself fully sanctify you, and may <strong>your whole spirit and soul and body</strong> be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.(1Thess. 5:23)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-spirit-of-human-died-because-of-sin">The spirit of human died because of sin.</h3>
<p>The existence is not lost, but the function is dead. The fact that a person&rsquo;s nerve is dead does not mean that there is no nerve, but that the sense of nerves is dead. Likewise it is not that the spirit do not exist, but that the function of spirit is dead.
It is the <strong>conscience that the spirit releases its presence faintly</strong> even in the midst of the death of the spirit. Conscience is the body of the spirit.
There is only one difference between animals and humans: humans have spirits and animals have no spirits. Because of this conscience, laws (institutions) were created. Animals have no law and no conscience because they have no spirits.</p>
<p>We must give <strong>the food of spirit</strong> to our spirit. That is <strong>the Word of God</strong>, just as we must give food to our flesh and knowledge to our mind,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Praise 🎵 Fill My Cup, Lord</p>

<h3 id="the-word-of-god-prayer-and-hymn-are-for-the-spirit">The word of God, prayer, and hymn are for the spirit.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, in regard to all things, I pray for you to prosper and to be in health, as your soul prospers. (3 John 1:2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which of the three is the most important, flesh, mind or spirit? Where should we invest a lot of time? Definitely, in your spirit! Don&rsquo;t your flesh rot when you die although you apply $1,000 cosmetics? The body eventually returns to the soil. So invest the most in your spirit but the least in your flesh to stay ‘just healthy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Where has the mind(soul) come from?</p>
<p>When God created man, he blew the breath of life and man became a living soul.
When you clap your left and right hands, it makes a sound. Likewise, the soul is like a intermediate wavelength phenomenon that occurs when the spirit acts inside the body.</p>
<p>For example, consider a light bulb connected to a wire.This wire is visible, but the electricity flowing in it is not visible. When electricity enters into a light bulb, light comes out and when electricity is cut off, then light disappears. When a person&rsquo;s spirit leaves off the body, the soul disappears. Soul is kind of one of the substances.</p>
<h3 id="the-human-spirit-never-goes-away">The human spirit never goes away.</h3>
<p>It seems that the substance which was the flesh disappears, but it does not actually disappear. Only the form has changed. As boiling water turns into water vapor, so not all of the chemical components of humans are gone. How much even that human spirit! <strong>The spirit that died of sin enters into the hellfire.</strong>
For those who like reading, take a look the world&rsquo;s leading American weekly magazine Reader&rsquo;s Digest. One theme per year deals with the afterlife - the experiences of people in the global village who died and woke up (mainly in hospitals), but their testimony is almost consistent as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>The spirit came out of the body.</li>
<li>Doctors diagnosed death sentence and one’s spirit watch family cry.</li>
<li>Then the light comes down from heaven. After passing through a dark tunnel drawn by light, those who died in the Asian region of the East continue to experience being sucked into the extreme darkness like the black hole, but most of the Westerners (Christians) are attracted to a brighter light and then awoke.
This is the real story - the story of people who awakened again after death sentence and dead body treatment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would you fall into hellfire along the darkness or follow the light to heaven after death?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t repent later in hell. Don&rsquo;t do it and make a clear choice now. Hell and heaven certainly exist.</p>
<p>Why are people afraid of death? If human dies and disappears, why not stop fearing death? Because there is something, human instinct already responds to the coming of death.</p>
<p>Human language is come into being by factual and existential things, the existence of a word means that it exists. What doesn&rsquo;t exist is not made in language. Therefore, Heaven and hell certainly exist.</p>
<p>When a person dies, we can see with 7~80% possibility whether he is going to heaven or hell. At the moment the body&rsquo;s eyes and mouth are closed, the spirit world is already opened before leaving the body. At that time, his mouth was closed and unable to speak (just before his spirit left). <strong>The spirit condemned to hell sees the Dark Devil waiting, but the spirit saved through the faith of Jesus Christ sees the Angel coming to pick him up.</strong></p>
<p>The Testimony of father of Pastor Jeon
My younger brother lived with his father while I am working in a pioneering church, but one day he hurriedly called me that father would die. So when I got there and behold, my father was throwing everything he could see in the room. I asked what you were doing, and he said, “The Black one over there came to catch me. I&rsquo;m fighting because I don&rsquo;t want to go! Don’t you can’t see it?”. So I held onto my father and prayed in the name of Jesus. “In the name of Jesus, go away! you Devil!”
Then my father fell asleep and awakened. After living long, he went to Heaven at the age of 80.</p>
<p>The Testimony of mother of Pastor Jeon
She was fainted by the blow of my father, and her spirit left and stood before God, and God said, “You are not supposed to be here yet. You have a job to do in the land of the living.” There is definitely a posthumous world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there is no heaven and hell. If you go to church hard and donate hard and die, all you have lost is just loss deceived by the pastor. However, you think that there is no heaven and hell, and live at your own will and die, but what would you do if you see there is real hell? So it&rsquo;s better to believe that it DOES exist.</p>
<p><strong>When we believe in Jesus Christ and receive forgiveness of sins through Jesus, the Holy Spirit enters into human beings to save the dead spirit. After dying, let&rsquo;s go to heaven together.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Praise 🎵 Since Christ my soul from sin set free</p>

<p><strong>In order for a person&rsquo;s dead soul to live, the gospel, the Word of God, must first pass through the body through the ears of the body and through the eyes.</strong> Since the spirit is at the deepest part of man (body→soul(mind)→spirit), the gospel that has passed through the body must pass through the gates of the mind. If the mind receives with AMEN, the gate will be opened. Then the Spirit of God enters into the person, and he becomes the child of God, and will be  born again through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The person who was born again also sins, but different from the state in which the spirit was dead. For example, if you rage when you don’t believe in Jesus, your being is unified and justifies your fury, but those who believe in Jesus and are saved and have the Holy Spirit in them have a force that does not support their anger. Such a person is a saved person. You don&rsquo;t have that power by yourself.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon is <em><strong>repentance.</strong></em> A person born of the Holy Spirit sins just like any other person, but he repents. <strong>The power to repent is given by the Holy Spirit in him.</strong> You are not going to hell because you have sinned, but you are going to hell because you have not repented. Man has no power to repent. <strong>Only those who have the Holy Spirit in them can repent.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Praise 🎵 The Bright, Heavenly Way</p>

<p><strong>How can I know whether my dead soul is really alive so that I can go to heaven after I die today?</strong>
Those who do not have the Holy Spirit have no sense when they miss the church on Sunday. However, people who have the Holy Spirit suffer even though they missed the church once on Sunday. Their soul and spirit are distressed because the sighing of the Holy Spirit in them presses them. In this way, you can know for yourself if the Holy Spirit has come into you.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Human beings are composed of spirit, soul, and flesh. The food of the flesh is food from the soil, and the food of the soul is knowledge. The food of the Spirit is the Word of God. Humans must live for the spirit, not just an animal that eats, grows, and perishes. Heaven and hell exist. <strong>In order not to go to hell, we must accept Jesus Christ and live according to the Word of God in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
