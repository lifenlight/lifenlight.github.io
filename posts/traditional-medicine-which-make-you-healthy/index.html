<h1 class="post-title">Traditional Medicine which make you healthy</h1>

        <p>
        <p>In 2008, TV showed an 93 old aged man who vigorously asserted he was in very good health condition at his age because he burned moxa on the appointed spot of skin on a regular basis - one time a day. It was amazing to see that he was hale and hearty. He demonstrated how to burn moxa on the skin and the appointed spots on the body which can improve one’s health and contribute to human longevity.</p>

The more surprising fact is that he is still alive - 105 years old as of in 2020 now, and that he is still hale and hearty! His name is Nam-su, Kim born in 1915. (and his nickname is Gudang)
<p>Oriental medicine, which mainly consists of Chinese, Korean and Japanese traditional medicine, has been developed and experienced by many generations to meet the medical care for each country. As you may know, acupuncture, moxibustion and herb medication are essential remedies for this kind of traditional medicine. Each remedy has its own strong point, for example, <em><strong>acupuncture is for acute and immediate care, moxibustion is for chronic disease and herb medication is for both acute and chronic.</strong></em> The combination of these remedies is also used for effective treatment.</p>
<p>Gudang is a kind of person who proved his secret of longevity by his regular doing - <strong>moxibustion on his appointed spots.</strong> What are these appointed spots? Gudang chose the appointed spot among meridian spots to improve one’s health for everyone and called the moxibustion on the appointed spots <strong>“Mu-guk-bo-yang-tm”(MGBYT)</strong> in Korean. “Mu-guk” means endlessness or boundlessness. “Bo-yang” means the good benefit of one’s health or nourishment. “Tm” means moxibustion. <em><strong>The appointed spots of Mu-guk-bo-yang-tm are 12 points for men and 13 points for women.</strong></em></p>

<p>I saw 95 year-old Gudang in person at the exam site who made an on-site inspection with some Chinese inspectors. I was surprised again to see his nimble movement when he stepped up stairs. His movement was like the young - natural and quick movement easily. So I confirmed what I learnt from him(his institute) is true.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-real-story">More about real story.</h2>
<p>There was a time when people in same class got together and said about their stories. I couldn’t forget one guy’s story until now. His mother was diagnosed as liver cancer and was told that she would live no longer than few months. Her children scrutinized any helpful therapies in order to get their mother retrieved from her disease. Finally, they found purple beet is very good to liver so they made beet juice to give her everyday. Regardless of doctor’s warning, she seemed to be recovered from her disease and lived more than just few months as her children expected. But she was a widow and felt lonely, starting smoking without her children knowing. After several months, she got worse and found her cancer had spread to the lung. Again, she was informed that she would live no longer than 3 months. Desperately, her children sought for anything to treat her cancer. They happened to know about moxibustion and decided to do moxibustion on their mother. They burned moxa on her after positioning the appointed spots for cancer treatment. (it also included spots of “Mu-guk-bo-yang-tm”) As you may know, a patient in the terminal stage of cancer would rather die quickly than recover because pain is so severe and there are no effective pain-killers in this stage. As she was going dead, feeling very comfortable after moxibustion, she adjured him to learn moxibustion by all means at all costs. Although she could not get over her disease, her son came to know that <em><strong>this moxibustion is very effective to relieve pains.</strong></em> When I heard him, I hoped <strong>this knowledge of traditional medicine should be spread to relieve pains and even to cure illness.</strong></p>
